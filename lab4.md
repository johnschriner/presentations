##FCM-742 - Network Security - Lab 4
I started with a fresh 15.10 Ubuntu VM in VirtualBox.<br>
I had no trouble with installations except I needed to install libpcap0.8 or libpcap-dev.<br>
I prefer, as you do, to import modules right into a python shell - in my case, iPython.<br>

I had no trouble with seeing the default values for scapy:<p>

One of the cooler things I discovered is <code>%save</code> and <code>%load</code> to save and load .py files for use in iPython.<br>
Of course, it's exporting all the commands from the notebook--even the mistakes--so it's necessary to scrub some of the commands with nano or gedit.<br>
