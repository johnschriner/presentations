##Lab 5 - Scapy recon

I generally read through the exercise before digging in to see what the exercise is designed to teach; the most interesting thing, already,
is to see that we run into problems with determining if ports are open--or simply filtered--when we use nmap.

Some academic reading first on stealth port-scanning attacks and defence: 
Network Forensics: Detection and Analysis of Stealth Port Scanning Attack (Rajni Ranjan Singh and Deepak Singh Tomar, 2015)[1]

I start with setting up a VM network with m0n0wall as the gateway.
