_When the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917, they began to make language policy for the hundreds of official and minority languages across the country.  This brief and non-exhaustive bibliography will look at particular language policy, how linguistics and academics changed, and the quest for a "Soviet linguistics."_
These are all accessible texts and all are English-language.  

_This area is interesting for the following reasons:  it was a giant landmass that the Bolshevik's inherited; the Bolsheviks had to fight a civil war on top of ending their part in WWI; the Muslim Turkic-world comprised much of central Asia with its own cultures; the vast majority of languages had no standard written form._

_This is a chronological set of essays that range from topics like pre-revolution linguistics to the bitter reaction to "bourgeois linguistics" in the early years of the revolution up to the 1930's.  One essay focuses on the academics of Stalin and nation-building.  Surprisingly little is mentioned of Marr and Japhetism except for an occasional awareness of official dogma._
