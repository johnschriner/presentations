_When the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917, they began to make language policy for the hundreds of official and minority languages across the country.  This brief and non-exhaustive bibliography will look at particular language policy, how linguistics and academics changed, and the quest for a "Soviet linguistics."_

These are all accessible texts and all are English-language.  

_This area is interesting for the following reasons:  it was a giant landmass that the Bolshevik's inherited; it's the birth of sociolinguistics in the Soviet Union; the Bolsheviks had to fight a civil war on top of ending their part in WWI; the Muslim Turkic-world comprised much of central Asia with its own cultures; the vast majority of languages had no standard written form._

_This is a chronological set of essays that range from topics like pre-revolution linguistics to the bitter reaction to "bourgeois linguistics" in the early years of the revolution up to the 1930's.  One essay focuses on the academics of Stalin and nation-building.  Surprisingly little is mentioned of Marr and Japhetism except for an occasional awareness of official dogma._

As a framework, Reznik uses Bourdieu's [theory of the scientific field and professional strategies](https://github.com/johnschriner/presentations/blob/master/soviet_linguistics_-_papers/Bourdieu%20(1975)%20The%20Specificity%20of%20the%20Scientific%20Field.pdf) to describe the academic environment before and after 1917.  Reznik traces Marr's ascent through the academy, to his professional societies, to his building of an institutional framework.  The paper explains Japhetic Theory but doesn't get bogged down.  It's the first article I've seen that provides an academic biography, his published findings in _Theses and Investigations in Armenian-Georgian Philology_, and his part in the Cultural Revolution.
